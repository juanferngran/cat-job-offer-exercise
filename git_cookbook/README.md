# Part 1: create cookbook 
	I set up the enviroment on Ubuntu 18.04 and installed successfully Chef Toolkit, VirtualBox and Vagrant. 
	Then, I used Kitchen features to create the Chef Cookbook. I've create a completely new cookbook intead of running the prestashop one.
	The solution proposed might not be the desired output as I haven't really used Docker, but I tried to create a Chef cookbook anyway. 

### Part 2 at file "default_test.rb"
	I wrote a test to prove the cookbook is running and listening on port 80.
